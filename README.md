# [kotlin-pcsc][]

Work-in-progress bindings for the [PC/SC][] API ([winscard][]) in Kotlin.

This was developed to enable a cleaner interface for the PC version of [Metrodroid][] (a public
transit card reader).

This is a [Kotlin Multiplatform][multi] project, which supports building using:

* **[JNA][]** on JVM (builds a single library for anything [JNA][] supports)
* **[Native][]** for [Kotlin/Native][native] apps

Platform           | [PC/SC][] Implementation | [JNA][] (JRE) | [Native][]
------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------- | ----------
Linux x86_64       | [pcsclite][]             | :o:           | :o:
macOS 10.14 x86_64 | `PCSC.framework`         | :o:           | :o:
Windows 10 x86_64  | [WinSCard.dll][winscard] | :o:           | :x:

> :warning: Cross-compiling **Native** targets is not supported.

## API

[API documentation can be viewed online][api-docs], or built locally with: `./gradlew dokkaHtml`

## Build and test

**Note:** Running tests requires a connected [PC/SC][]-compatible smart card reader, and a card
connected to it.

All targets require JDK 9 or later to be installed (for Gradle).

### JNA (all platforms)

```sh
./gradlew :jnaMainClasses :jnaTest
```

This builds for all platforms, as the prebuilt `net.java.dev.jna` package already includes
platform-specific JNI helpers.  You don't need any cross-compiling or special machine for that.

### Native targets
#### Linux

Required packages: `libpcsclite1 libpcsclite-dev`

```sh
./gradlew :linuxX64MainKlibrary :linuxX64Test
```

#### macOS

Required packages: Xcode 11 or later

```sh
./gradlew :macosX64MainKlibrary :macosX64Test
```

#### Windows

**Note:** Not working yet.

## Runtime notes

### Linux (JNA and Native)

Install `libpcsclite1` and `pcscd` packages.

If you're using a reader with NXP PN53x series chipset (eg: ACS ARC122U), recent Linux kernels
include an `pn533_usb` kernel module, which implements a new Linux-kernel-specific NFC subsystem
that is **incompatible all existing software**. You'll need to block it from loading to allow
`libacsccid1` (its PC/SC IFD handler) to work properly:

```sh
echo "blacklist pn533_usb" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
sudo rmmod pn533_usb
```

Then unplug and replug the device.

## FAQ

#### Is there an example of use?

Yes!  See [the `sample` directory of this repository](./sample/).

This supports building on all target platforms, and includes a `jnaFatJar` task, which pulls in all
dependencies to a single JAR file.

#### How does this relate to javax.smartcardio?

This is _entirely different_ to the `javax.smartcardio` which was included in Java 8 and earlier.
It does not support these APIs at all, even when they are available.

If you want to use that API, take a look at [jnasmartcardio][]. This project's JNA implementation
was inspired by it.

#### What about mobile (Android / iOS) support?

This is explicitly _not_ in scope for this project.

Most mobile devices do not offer a [PC/SC][]-compatible API. The few devices that _do_ run a regular
enough Linux userland that you should be able to build using that.

#### How do I use this to connect to FeliCa / MIFARE / etc?

You'll need to provide your own implementation of those protocols. PC/SC only provides a very low
level interface, and you'll be sending `ByteArray` to the ICC and getting `ByteArray` back.

We don't even parse the APDUs for you...
